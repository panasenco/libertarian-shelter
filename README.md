# Sol Citizen
An uncompromising general education curriculum

## Tests consume education

A curriculum can be interpreted through one of two lenses:
- What will be *taught*
- What will be *tested*

With the emergence of multiple-choice tests in the early 20th century, and the general movement towards industrial efficiency in educational testing, the scope of how we think about testing and examinations keeps narrowing.
We can now only incredulously look back at the tradition of including oral debates and individual presentations as parts of examinations at the beginnings of the first European universities.
Such individualistic luxuries are unimaginable to students of the 21st century.

The dynamic of increasingly industrialized standardized tests becoming more and more important has made the curriculum focus more and more on what *can* be tested with such tests.
This creates pressure to cut whatever lessons there are for which the outcome can't be measured with a multiple choice test out of curriculums, no matter how important those lessons are.

Though tests may have been originally intended only to approximately mesaure the effectiveness of an educational process, they have instead consumed the educational process.
The test is now the essence of education.

## Testing outside education

In an industrial-like context outside of education, tests are undeniably important.
Nuts and bolts produced in a factory are constantly tested to ensure they are within tolerances.
In a food processing plant, food items are constantly tested for presence of harmful bacteria.
In a software context, software components are constantly tested to make sure errors aren't introduced during development.
It's not an exaggeration that almost every object we depend on in the modern world wouldn't be possible without testing.

However, people aren't objects, and schools aren't supposed to be factories.
The purpose of a school shouldn't be to produce a human being who's within 0.1mm tolerance on twenty different dimensions of educational curriculum.
The purpose *must* be something else!

## Throwing away standardized tests

If we (perhaps temporarily) throw out the 'what will be tested' part of the curriculum, we're left with 'what will be taught'.
How can we measure what was taught if we don't have standardized testing?
Once again we're challenged to move away from the industrial point of view.
Measuring what was taught doesn't have to mean 'the student must demonstrate that the contents of their brain are within an acceptable tolerance of the curriculum'.
What if we measure the *engagement* during the lesson instead?

After all, if the following conditions are met:
- The 'heart' of an educational experience is defined well in the curriculum
- The teacher does their best to create an engaging educational experience that captures that 'heart'
- The students do their best to engage with the educational experience created by the teacher

Then haven't all the humans in this situation done all they could?
The curriculum designer, the teacher, and the students in this situation should surely all be commended for their excellent work.

Though we don't know that the contents of the students' brains after this experience is within a certain tolerance of whatever, it shouldn't matter if we believe that humans aren't meant to be mass produced like nuts and bolts in a factory.

## Curriculum creation process

*"Hey! Politician! Leave those teachers alone!"* - Pink Floyd, probably.

The pressure of creating multiple-choice-testable lessons on its own is not enough to explain the abhorrent soul-crushing state of modern educational curriculums.
After all, there are genuinely interesting and insightful lessons that can still be tested with multiple choice tests.
They're just conspicuously absent from curriculums.
Instead, curriculums are full of topics that are too safe, bland, and conservative for people to even object to.
What's the reason for this?

This soul-crushing blandness is the inevitable result of *design by committee*.
The more people have veto power on a design of anything, whether it be of a curriculum, or a car, or a government policy, or a piece of software, the more bland and conservative that design is going to turn out.
The reason for this is simple: People in general tend to prefer familar to the unfamiliar.
An innovative feature will be objectionable to a higher percentage of the population than a familiar feature.
People feel more entitled to be able to object to something new than to something old.
Even if three randomly selected people are all partial to a particular innovation, what about ten or twenty?
Just thinking statistically, at least one of them would object.
And so one by one, innovative features are stripped from a design.
When only the most familiar, bland, and conservative features are left that no one can object to, the design is finalized.

An excellent curriculum probably can't make a terrible teacher good, but a terrible curriculum can surely make a great teacher suffer.
The effects of design by committee at the top trickle down throughout the entire educational system and drive out or burn out innovators and visionaries.

Fear not, for what can be broken with game theory can also be fixed with game theory.

In the first place, conservatism in education doesn't make sense.
An average student will go through dozens of different teachers in their journey.
If all of those teachers are doing something innovative and interesting, even if half of them completely fail to teach effectively, there's still the other half that creates completely incredible experiences for the student.
Just one such incredible experience with a teacher can be enough to change a student's life.
Even the failed experiences can be valuable and meaningful because they're at least not soul-crushingly bland.
Unlike machines that need carefully controlled external conditions, humans thrive in an environment with a diversity of experiences.

From a game theory perspective, conservatism in curriculum design needs to be punished and innovation rewarded.
First, the number of reviewers needs to be reduced.
Second, the questions that are asked by reviewers when considering a proposed change to the curriculum should carry a bias towards innovation.

Consider questions like:
- Is this important knowledge?
- Will this help students succeed in the 'real world'?
- Is learning this foundational to learning other important things in the future?

The above questions all sound innocuous enough, but carry a hidden bias towards conservatism and against innovation.
It's impossible for ten people to agree that a truly innovative lesson is important knowledge, or will help the students succeed in the corporate rat race.
It's certainly impossible for something truly innovative to be foundational for learning something else (for now).

Instead, questions should be designed with a bias towards innovation. For example:
- Is this lesson bland and/or soul-crushing?
- Does this lesson uplift the students' spirits?
- Is the heart of this lesson a new and interesting way to think about the world?

## The Sol Citizen curriculum pillars

With all of the above in mind, let's create an innovative curriculum that throws out the soul-crushing and conservative approaches of education, and instead focuses on viewing students as human beings, not machines.

The following will be the pillars of our new curriculum.
Most people will probably vehemently object to at least one of these, but that's by design.
As explained above, a great educational experience can't be created by pleasing everyone.
- **Psychology and game theory.**
  The heart of this pillar is to create adults that won't lose heart when encountering organizational, cultural, and legal obstacles.
  Students will play games and gain first-hand experiences with how individual psychology and organizational rules can kill the human spirit, like we discussed above.
  They'll also learn how those who make the rules of the game can attain ever-greater power and wealth and exercise ever-greater control and manipulation.
  Of course, they'll also learn how to counteract these factors and where to strike to shatter these systems.
  This pillar subsumes the following 'classic' subjects:
  - History

  And includes the following new subjects:
  - Psychology of manipulation and control
  - Game theory (how to create game rules that benefit you in non-obvious ways)
  - Financial mathematics
  - Economics
- **Creativity.**
  Creating things that do what you want them to do is *hard*.
  Regardless of whether you're creating a painting, a mechanism, a computer program, a book, or a song, brushing up against greatness feels like doing battle against the universe.
  Students will be guided in creating what they want to create.
  The heart of this pillar is to give students the experience of the enormous difficulty of creativity as well as overcoming that difficulty and emerging victorious over and over.
  This pillar subsumes the following 'classic' subjects:
  - Reading and writing
  - Math
  - Science
  - Design and technology
  - Art and design
  - Computing
  
  And includes the following new subjects:
  - Wood working
  - 3D printing
  - Electronics lab
- **Wellness.**
  The heart of this pillar is to create a foundation of knowledge about personall wellness as well as experience of achieving it that can last the student's whole lifetime.
  Students must somehow be taught how to *want* to eat well and *want* to stay fit.
  More than that, students must be taught to love their own bodies and not be scared of them.
  Mental health should also be touched on.
  I have no idea how to achieve any of this.
  This pillar subsumes the following 'classic' subjects:
  - Physical education
  - Relationships and health education
  - Personal, social, and health education
  - Sex education
- **Electives.**
  'Classic' subjects that don't fit at all into the main three pillars:
  - Geography
  - Foreign languages
