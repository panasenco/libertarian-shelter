An uncompromising general education curriculum

## A world without curriculums

*Hey! Administrator! Leave those teachers alone!* - Pink Floyd, probably.

Are centralized curriculums even necessary in education, or are they just another invention of self-propagating bureaucracy?
Why can we not just let teachers teach how they will?

Let's imagine such a world where we ban all centrally imposed educational curriculums and live happily ever after.
Every teacher is free to create their own curriculum, if any at all.
It's freedom, anarchy baby, woohoo!

After all, can great things not happen when you let well-trained, intelligent, and driven people free to do their best without red tape?

About that, though - How do we know those teachers are well-trained?

Suppose teachers who teach whatever they like and however they like produce students who also go on to become teachers who teach whatever they like and however they like, and so on for generations.
Isn't that just a society that completely gave up on education at that point?
The rich and powerful in such a society would probably send their children to private schools with actual curriculums, while everyone else's kids would take what they can get.

But wait, we're not out of tricks!
We banned centralized curriculums, but never centralized standardized tests!
We could just test people before allowing them to become teachers!
After all, why does it matter how a person got to a destination as long as they get there?

A world where standardized tests are king and curriculums are under-emphasized...
Well, we don't have to strain our imaginations too hard to imagine such a world.
